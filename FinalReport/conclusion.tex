The purpose of this project was to classify characters in digital image. The model is trained and accurately predict the class
of character images. However, as mentioned, one of the challenges is to distinguish similar lower and upper case characters. This
challenge needs to be fixed in the stage of collecting input data or usage in applications. Moreover, the model can only predict
the one characters at a time. Recognizing phrases or sentences from 'memes' requires recognizing multiple characters. The future works
should focus on how to retrieve characters from 'memes' or utilizing this model for applications.
