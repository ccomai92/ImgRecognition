Machine learning in character recognition in images is one of the popular research topics. It is well known that many machine learning
packages or models have been built to recognize characters in text or pdf files. Moreover, many research delved into recognizing
hand written characters or characters in natural images. It is rare to find any research focusing on recognizing characters in
'meme' images. Generally, memes contain digitally created characters in images. Searching memes from search engines rely on the
belonged hash-tags that uploader additionally uploaded. This paper focuses on recognizing digital character images, one by one. The model
is trained in convolutional neural networks and classify the character images. It explains the methods that were utilized to train and
analyzes the model from experimental results.
