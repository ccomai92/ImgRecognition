Meme is a humorous image, video,
or piece of text that is copied and spread
rapidly by Internet users. Sometimes, people
want to search meme online and show it to their
friends that they liked. However,
often, it is hard to find the meme that a person
is looking for. Currently, online meme search engines are
relying on the hash tags to match user inputs with the results.
However, normally, users do not catch the phrase from the
hash tags, but the actual contents in the image. Therefore, it
would be useful to have meme search engines to have
an algorithm that can find the memes based on the word contents
inside the images.

Convolutional Neural Networks is a popular method to recognize images and
classify its label. Currently, there are many research focusing on utilizing
this method to recognize text images in real life. However, classifying
memes is different in that words in the memes are graphically added as contents.
Therefore, making a model for classifying graphically oriented characters
would be useful for developing search engines for memes.

The main goal of this project is to contribute to the developers who
would build a meme search engine for the users. To begin with, this project
will focus on classifying graphical characters. This paper will explain how
the model was built with the convolutional neural networking methods.
