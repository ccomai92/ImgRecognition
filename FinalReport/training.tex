The method of Convolutional Nerual Networks requires multiple layers in the process of trianing.
In a big picture, the layers could be divided into three layers: input, hidden, and output layers.
The input layer receives input, data such as matrices, and output layer produces the result values produced
by the model. Result values are N by the number of unique characters matrix that each vector contains the
probability of input to be the character of the corresponding index numbers. The layers are implemented while
utilizing the Tensorflow python package.

The hidden are further divided into three layers: Convolution, Flattening, and Fully Coonnected layers.
